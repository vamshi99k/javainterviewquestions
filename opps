1.what is class?
		>class is blueprint which is a collection of individual objects
		>class is a logica entity
		>without class object cannot be created
		>class contain follwing members: -blocks
										 -states
										 -bheaviours
										 -nested classes
		
2.object:
        
		>object is instance of class
		>any physical or non physical entity that has defined state and bheaviours
		>object cannot be created without class
		>one object can have more than one reference
		>software objects are often used to model real world objects>
		>multiple objects are created from same class called similar objects
		
		
		
3.#abstraction:
        >abstracton is the process of hiding the implementaion and showing the functionality to the user
		
		>abstraction is achieved through abstract keyword
		
		>abstract keyword can be used with methods & classes
		
		
		#abstract methods:
							abstract methods are such methods which have only method declaration but will 
							not have method definiton
							-they are not incomplted methods
		#abstract classes:
							-abstract classess are such classes for which 
							 objects cannot be created
							-these classes cannot be instatiated howevr there is one rule for abstract classes
							that is:
							      if in a class one method is abstract then the class must be declared as abstact class
								  
								  
								  





#INTERFACE IN JAVA
===================


#interface:
			interface is a collection of abstract methods.since java8 ,it can have also
			default methods and static methods.
			
		important poits:
			>interface can have only final and static variables
			>interface helps to achive standardziation
			>an interface can be implemented by using implements keyword
			>interface can have any number of implementaions
			>interface promots polymorphism and loose coupling
			>using interface reference the overriden methods invokes directly
			>oject of interface and instance of oject acnnot be created
			>an intefcae cannot implemented from another interface
			>by using interface we can achive 100% abstraction.
			>interface supports multiple inheritance
			>an interface caan extends another interface only
			>interface can not provide implementaion of abstract class
			
			
			
			
			
#POLYMORISM
===========

			one object have many forms is know as polymorphism
			
			#compiletime/static polymorphism:
						any entity which shows polymorphism during compie time is called static polymorphism
						example:
						     operator overlpading,method overloading,constructor over loading
			
			#runtime/dynamic polymorphism:
			            any entity which shows polymorphism during runtime is   called dynamic polymorphism
						    Example: method overriding
							
							
#ENCAPSULATION IN JAVA
=======================
            it is a technique that making the fields in a class private and provide the access via public methods 
			
			-if a field is declared as private .it cannot be accessed by anyone outside the class there by hiding the fields  within a class
			-
			encapsulation is achieved through private keyword

#wrapper classes in java:
                         these are classes which allow primtive types to be accessed as objects
						 
						 by using WRAPPER CLASSES we can achive pure object orienation programming
						 
						 
						 
						 
	#boxing:
				converting primitive datatype to object is called object
				
	#unboxing: 
				where as converting object to corresponding primitive datatype is called unboxing
