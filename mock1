==============================
1.METHOD OVERLOADING:
					one  class can have more than one method having same name by differing in the 
					-no of parameters
					-type of parameters
					-Sequence of parameters   is called method overloading
					
					
					example:object class have 3 weight methods
					


2.CONSTRUCTOR OVERLOADING:
					one class has more than one cpnstructor by differing in 
					-no of parameters
					-type of parameters
					-sequence of parameters  is called constructor overloading
					
					example: ArrayList has 3 constructors
					         string has 15 contructors
					
					NOte: we can overload any type of methods


3.super keyword:
					-super keyword with variable is used to resolve the name clash between 
					 chile class varible and parent class varible .
					-super keyword as a method is used to achive constructot chaining.
					
4.this keywword:
					-this keyword is used to reslove the shadowing probelm
					-it is used to achive loacal chaining when it is used as method in constructor

5.constructor chaining:
					
					the process of taking control from child class constructor to parent class 
					constructor using super() calls statement is  called constructor chainig
					
					
6.Local chaining:
					the process of taking control from one constructor to another constructor .it
					can be achievd by using this() call statement.
			
7.method overriding:
					
					-the process of redefining the superclass method in the subclass
					 we call it as method overridig
					 
					 -while overriding method signature must be same as sperclass
					 
					 example: string class overriding the 
					           equals()
							   toString() methods



8.WHAT IS INHERITANCE:

					-The process of aquiring the properties of one class by another class is called inheritance
					
					@Adavantages:
					-------------
					-code can be reduced
					-time for the project completion will be reduced
					-prfit will be incresed
					
					note :
					 -we cannot ovrride the static,final,private methods of supercalss
					 
					#there are 5 types of inheritances there:
					-single level
					-multi level
					-multiple
					-herirachial
					-hybrid
					
9.why java not support multiple inheritance:

					
					#reason1
					-becuse in java all clasess are inherited the object class properties
					 when we tried aquire more the one super class properties we will get ambiguity
					 
					#reason2
					  when we invoke the subclass construtr it implicitly invokes the super class constructor 
					  when one class has more than one super class agian subclass constructor get ambuiguity
					  this proble is know as daimond shape problem
